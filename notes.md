# Notes

-   JS when passing objects and array is pass by reference
-   all are truthy except: 0, NaN, undefined, null, & ''
-   negative are truthy values
-   " " is truthy, while "" is falsy
-   binary search works for sorted array
    -   divides array to middle
    -   easy to understand, tricky to implement
-   sequential search
    -   interates through the whole array one by one
    -   does not need to be sorted
-   strings are passed by reference
-   strings has a method of lastIndexOf
-   strings.split() turns string to array
-   strings has a method for removing spaces, doesn't change original string
    -   trim()
    -   trimStart()
    -   trimEnd()
-   Js number has a safe limit, use BigInt for bigger number
-   BigInt number ends with n e.g. 1n, 9007199254740991n
-   you can convert array contents with map(dataType) e.g. map(Number)
-   array.shift() changes the whole array by removing first element
-   array.unshift(value) change the array by adding the value in the first index
-   you can convert binary string to int with parseInt(variable, 2)
    -   but cant handle long values
-   you can convert binary string to BigInt with BigInt(`0b${variable}`)
    -   better holding long values
-   you can convert decimal to binary using Number.toString(2)
-   in for loop, the condition is dynamic. so if in property length, it can change
-   x \* x = z === x = z/x (from sqrt problem)
-   square root of a number can only exist with its (target/2) + 1
-   there is no range() in js
-   spread operator ...
    -   allows an iterable, such as an array or string, to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected.
    -   In an object literal, the spread syntax enumerates the properties of an object and adds the key-value pairs to the object being created.
-   sort function by default, sort elements by ascending alphanumeric
    -   built upon converting the elements into strings, then comparing their sequences of UTF-16 code units values.
    -   to sort reverse fo reverse()
    -   to sort numerically do sort(function (a, b) {return a - b})
    -   to sort reverse do sort(function (a, b){return b - a})
-   regex to remove special characters, including space is `/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, "" `
-   string method split('') converts string/characters to array
-   array method join('') converts array to string
-   string has a method for casings
    -   toUpperCase()
    -   toLowerCase()
-   ways to convert string to array
    -   split('')
    -   Array.from()
-   reverse method is only in array not in string :'(
-   bitwise operator ^ performs XOR
    -   0 ^ 0 = 0
    -   1 ^ 1 = 0
    -   0 ^ 1 = 1
    -   1 ^ 0 = 1
    -   when performing ^ on two/EVEN instances of a same number, it cancels each other => 0
-   boyer moore algorithm, mainly used for finding pattern in pool of strings
    -   can be used find the majority element
        -   ONLY! with the assumption that there is always a majority element who's > n/2
    -   has 2 rules
        -   bad character rule --> find the same character in the pattern and move to the right
        -   suffix rule --> find the fit suffix in the pattern and move to the right
-   in object, if a key is not present it would return undefine
    -   to solve this just use or
        -   numInstances[nums[i]] = numInstances[nums[i]] + 1 || 1;
-   in for loop, you can declare two variables and iterate them differently since loop condition is dynamic
    -   sample : for(let i = 0, j = s.length-1; i <= j ; i++, j--)
-   ES6 destructuring assignment
    -   deSTRUCTuring not deconstructuring
    -   a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables
    -   [a, b] = [10, 20]; --> a = 10, b = 20
    -   [a, b, ...rest] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] //spreader or rest property
        -   a = 10
        -   b = 20
        -   c = Array [30, 40, 50]
    -   obj = {a: 1, b: 2}; {a, b} = obj
    -   a = obj.a
    -   b = obj.b
    -   function f() {return [1, 2, 3];} const [a, , b] = f(); const [c] = f();
        -   a = 1
        -   b = 3
        -   c = 1
    -   !!! in the code block " console.log("sample") [a, b] = [10, 20] " would result to error
        -   syntax is corrent but Add a semicolon to prevent the automatic semicolon insertion from thinking you want to do console.log(...)[...] instead of array destructuring
        -   proper -> console.log("sample"); [a, b] = [10, 20]
        -   great example on the importance of adding semicolon
-   You can use OR || to check if an array has an element with that index
    -   mergeString += word1[i] || ''
-   Git warning "warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF"
    -   In Unix systems the end of a line is represented with a line feed (LF). In windows a line is represented with a carriage return (CR) and a line feed (LF) thus (CRLF).when you get code from git that was uploaded from a unix system they will only have an LF.
-   String has a method to repeat string --> string.repeat(int)
-   when the largest/longest is needed, try being greedy and search while decrementing
-   in handling pattern you can use this to quickly compare/test str1+str2 != str2+str1
-   in computing GCD - EUCLIDEAN ALGORITHM can be used
    -   the length/two numbers are subtracted to each other by the largest - smallest
    -   when the result is now equal or it will produce a 0 result, it is the GCD
