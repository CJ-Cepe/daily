# Notes

-   JS when passing objects and array is pass by reference
-   all are truthy except: 0, NaN, undefined, null, & ''
-   negative are truthy values
-   " " is truthy, while "" is falsy
-   binary search works for sorted array
    -   divides array to middle
    -   easy to understand, tricky to implement
-   sequential search
    -   interates through the whole array one by one
    -   does not need to be sorted
-   strings are passed by reference
-   strings has a method of lastIndexOf
-   strings.split() turns string to array
-   strings has a method for removing spaces, doesn't change original string
    -   trim()
    -   trimStart()
    -   trimEnd()
-   Js number has a safe limit, use BigInt for bigger number
-   BigInt number ends with n e.g. 1n, 9007199254740991n
-   you can convert array contents with map(dataType) e.g. map(Number)
-   array.shift() changes the whole array by removing first element
-   array.unshift(value) change the array by adding the value in the first index
-   you can convert binary string to int with parseInt(variable, 2)
    -   but cant handle long values
-   you can convert binary string to BigInt with BigInt(`0b${variable}`)
    -   better holding long values
-   you can convert decimal to binary using Number.toString(2)
-   in for loop, the condition is dynamic. so if in property length, it can change
-   x \* x = z === x = z/x (from sqrt problem)
-   square root of a number can only exist with its (target/2) + 1
-   there is no range() in js
-   spread operator ...
    -   allows an iterable, such as an array or string, to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected.
    -   In an object literal, the spread syntax enumerates the properties of an object and adds the key-value pairs to the object being created.
-   sort function by default, sort elements by ascending alphanumeric
    -   built upon converting the elements into strings, then comparing their sequences of UTF-16 code units values.
    -   to sort reverse fo reverse()
    -   to sort numerically do sort(function (a, b) {return a - b})
    -   to sort reverse do sort(function (a, b){return b - a})
-   regex to remove special characters, including space is `/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, "" `
-   string method split('') converts string/characters to array
-   array method join('') converts array to string
-   string has a method for casings
    -   toUpperCase()
    -   toLowerCase()
-   ways to convert string to array
    -   split('')
    -   Array.from()
-   reverse method is only in array not in string :'(
-   bitwise operator ^ performs XOR
    -   0 ^ 0 = 0
    -   1 ^ 1 = 0
    -   0 ^ 1 = 1
    -   1 ^ 0 = 1
    -   when performing ^ on two/EVEN instances of a same number, it cancels each other => 0
-   boyer moore algorithm, mainly used for finding pattern in pool of strings
    -   can be used find the majority element
        -   ONLY! with the assumption that there is always a majority element who's > n/2
    -   has 2 rules
        -   bad character rule --> find the same character in the pattern and move to the right
        -   suffix rule --> find the fit suffix in the pattern and move to the right
-   in object, if a key is not present it would return undefine
    -   to solve this just use or
        -   numInstances[nums[i]] = numInstances[nums[i]] + 1 || 1;
-   in for loop, you can declare two variables and iterate them differently since loop condition is dynamic
    -   sample : for(let i = 0, j = s.length-1; i <= j ; i++, j--)
-   ES6 destructuring assignment
    -   deSTRUCTuring not deconstructuring
    -   a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables
    -   [a, b] = [10, 20]; --> a = 10, b = 20
    -   [a, b, ...rest] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] //spreader or rest property
        -   a = 10
        -   b = 20
        -   c = Array [30, 40, 50]
    -   obj = {a: 1, b: 2}; {a, b} = obj
    -   a = obj.a
    -   b = obj.b
    -   function f() {return [1, 2, 3];} const [a, , b] = f(); const [c] = f();
        -   a = 1
        -   b = 3
        -   c = 1
    -   !!! in the code block " console.log("sample") [a, b] = [10, 20] " would result to error
        -   syntax is corrent but Add a semicolon to prevent the automatic semicolon insertion from thinking you want to do console.log(...)[...] instead of array destructuring
        -   proper -> console.log("sample"); [a, b] = [10, 20]
        -   great example on the importance of adding semicolon
-   You can use OR || to check if an array has an element with that index
    -   mergeString += word1[i] || ''
-   Git warning "warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF"
    -   In Unix systems the end of a line is represented with a line feed (LF). In windows a line is represented with a carriage return (CR) and a line feed (LF) thus (CRLF).when you get code from git that was uploaded from a unix system they will only have an LF.
-   String has a method to repeat string --> string.repeat(int)
-   when the largest/longest is needed, try being greedy and search while decrementing
-   in handling pattern you can use this to quickly compare/test str1+str2 != str2+str1
-   in computing GCD - EUCLIDEAN ALGORITHM can be used
    -   the length/two numbers are subtracted to each other by the largest - smallest
    -   when the result is now equal or it will produce a 0 result, it is the GCD
-   you can use largest = Math.max(...candies) to identify the largest number in an array
-   to convert values to its boolean equivalent
    -   !!variable
    -   boolean(variable)
-   initializing, defining, vs declaration
-   toLowerCase() exist
-   when handling string, it is usually better to convert it into array to use array methods and properties
    -   when handling string, always consider the casing and special characters
    -   string does not have ES6 array destructuring
    -   string.split('') -> array
    -   array.join('') -> string
    -   array.inludes(s[i].toLowerCase()) --> can be use to check if present aw well as handle uppercase
-   objects are passed by reference
    -   this means that the variable passed becomes a local one that contains the same reference
    -   even if you change the local variable, it wont change the one in the outside
-   iterators ++a and a++ changes the variable
    -   a = 5
    -   b = ++a
    -   a = 6
    -   a + b = 12
-   sets are like array, but for handling arrays that needs to be unique
    -   sets are created/initialize using constructor only
        -   new Sets([array])
    -   A JavaScript Set is a collection of unique values.
    -   Each value can only occur once in a Set.
    -   A Set can hold any value of any data type.
-   comma is an operator
    -   evaluates each of its operands (from left to right) and returns the value of the last operand.
    -   The comma operator is completely different from commas used as syntactic separators in other locations
    -   let a = (1, 2, 3) a = 3
-   An empty string or undefined value are falsy, but an empty array or object are truthy.
-   Object keys can only be strings, and even though a developer can use other data types to set an object key, JavaScript automatically converts keys to a string value.
-   Not working, a = {watermelon: 1}
    -   console.log(a[watermelon])
-   array.fill() can be used to fill an array
-   new Array () constructor can be used to make new array
    -   array literal is less risky than constructor
-   You can assign the same value to multiple variables using this syntax
    -   a = b = c = value
-   You can literally assign Infinity as value.
    -   Infinity
    -   -Infinity
-   The Infinity global property is a numeric value representing infinity
    -   The value Infinity (positive infinity) is greater than any other number.
        -   This value behaves slightly differently than mathematical infinity
            -   console.log(Infinity); /_ Infinity _/
            -   console.log(Infinity + 1); /_ Infinity _/
            -   console.log(Math.pow(10, 1000)); /_ Infinity _/
            -   console.log(Math.log(0)); /_ -Infinity _/
            -   console.log(1 / Infinity); /_ 0 _/
            -   console.log(1 / 0); /_ Infinity _/
-   in a set, you can use the delete method "set.delete(value)" to remove a value
-   to check if a set contains a certain element, use .has() method. as array hace .includes()
    -   significantly faster than using array and using .includes()
-   every method
    -   The every() method of Array instances tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function. It returns a Boolean value.
    -   every acts like the "for all" quantifier in mathematics. In particular, for an empty array, it returns true. (It is vacuously true that all elements of the empty set satisfy any given condition.)
        -callbackFn is invoked only for array indexes which have assigned values. It is not invoked for empty slots in sparse arrays.
-   to make a copy of an array, copy by value not by reference, use ...Variable, spreader operatorcclea
-   when dealing with sliding windows, as much as possible use the information from the previous batch to the next. such as the case for LC -643
-   object keys when created, using number as key, is not sorted
    -   just give illusion of being sorted when using index i in for loop
-   sets when created, the numbers are NOT sorted
-   if you initialize inside a for loop, its value will repeat every time the line is parse
-   the shorthand += will not work when using on variables being declared (for the first time) or being initialized, or at the same time with the keyword let
