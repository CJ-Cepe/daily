# Notes

-   JS when passing objects and array is pass by reference
-   all are truthy except: 0, NaN, undefined, null, & ''
-   negative are truthy values
-   " " is truthy, while "" is falsy
-   binary search works for sorted array
    -   divides array to middle
    -   easy to understand, tricky to implement
-   sequential search
    -   interates through the whole array one by one
    -   does not need to be sorted
-   strings are passed by reference
-   strings has a method of lastIndexOf
-   strings.split() turns string to array
-   strings has a method for removing spaces, doesn't change original string
    -   trim()
    -   trimStart()
    -   trimEnd()
-   Js number has a safe limit, use BigInt for bigger number
-   BigInt number ends with n e.g. 1n, 9007199254740991n
-   you can convert array contents with map(dataType) e.g. map(Number)
-   array.shift() changes the whole array by removing first element
-   array.unshift(value) change the array by adding the value in the first index
-   you can convert binary string to int with parseInt(variable, 2)
    -   but cant handle long values
-   you can convert binary string to BigInt with BigInt(`0b${variable}`)
    -   better holding long values
-   you can convert decimal to binary using Number.toString(2)
-   in for loop, the condition is dynamic. so if in property length, it can change
