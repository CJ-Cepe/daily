#Notes

-   JS when passing objects and array is pass by reference
-   all are truthy except: 0, NaN, undefined, null, & ''
-   negative are truthy values
-   " " is truthy, while "" is falsy
-   binary search works for sorted array
    -   divides array to middle
    -   easy to understand, tricky to implement
-   sequential search
    -   interates through the whole array one by one
    -   does not need to be sorted
-   strings are passed by reference
-   strings has a method of lastIndexOf
-   strings.split() turns string to array
-   strings has a method for removing spaces, doesn't change original string
    -   trim()
    -   trimStart()
    -   trimEnd()
