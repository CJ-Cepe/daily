# Data Structures and Algorithms

-   ## Big O

    -   a notation used to describe the computational complexity of an algorithm.
    -   ### Time Complexity
        -   the amount of time the algorithm needs to run relative to the input size
    -   ### Space Complexity
        -   the amount of memory allocated by the algorithm when run relative to the input size
    -   ### How complexity works

        -   **Complexity is described by a function**
        -   The arguments are defined by the programmer

            -   The most common variable you'll see is **n**, which usually denotes the length of an input array or string.
            -   Technically, you could introduce another variable, let's say _k_ which denotes the average value of the integers in the array. However, nobody does this.

        -   Assumptions (In the context of interviews)
            -   when dealing with integers, the larger the value, the more time operations like addition, multiplication, or printing will take
                -   we typically ignore this fact because the difference is practically very small
