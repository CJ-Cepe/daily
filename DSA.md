# Data Structures and Algorithms

-   Big O
    -   a notation used to describe the computational complexity of an algorithm.
    -   Time Complexity
        -   the amount of time the algorithm needs to run relative to the input size
    -   Space Complexity
        -   the amount of memory allocated by the algorithm when run relative to the input size
    -   How complexity works
        -   Complexity is described by a function
        -   The arguments are defined by the programmer
            -   The most common variable you'll see is n, which usually denotes the length of an input array or string.
        -   Assumptions
            -   when dealing with integers, the larger the value, the more time operations like addition, multiplication, or printing will take
    -   Analyzing time complexity
    -   Analyzing space complexity
